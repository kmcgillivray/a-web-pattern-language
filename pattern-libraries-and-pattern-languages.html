    <h1>Pattern libraries and pattern languages</h1>
    <h2>From atomic design to grammatical design</h2>

    <p>This page will outline the differences between pattern libraries and pattern languages—why pattern libraries are important, why they became a standard design tool, and why pattern languages need similar adoption.</p>

    <h2>Pattern libraries are tools for atomic design</h2>

    <p>Pattern libraries are a "kit of parts," a system of pre-built, reusable components that interface with each other to form emergent higher order patterns. This process might be called [[Atomic design]], comparable to atoms combining to form molecules or building towers with LEGO bricks.</p>
    <p>In software interface design and development, pattern libraries often contain copiable code that can be used to create an instance of the pattern. As a connectable collection of reliable solutions to common situations, [[Pattern libraries increase iteration speed and coordinate consistency]] within a software development team.</p>
    <p>Pattern libraries are typically designed with a specific organization, set of projects, style, or use case in mind. This specificity combined with the convenience of prebuilt parts can make them difficult to modify—each instance of a pattern is statically linked and consistent with every other instance. Some components may be configurable, but often the library needs to be extended with new components to meet unique needs within the context of each design.</p>

    <h2>Pattern languages are frameworks for grammatical design</h2>
    <p>Pattern languages are similar to pattern libraries; they are a collection of reliable approaches to solving common problems. However, patterns in a pattern language are not as specific and defined as patterns in a pattern library. They are more like rules of thumb to use while building components rather than the pre-built components themselves.</p>

    <p>Designing with a pattern language is similar to writing a sentence.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The patterns are dynamic the way words in a language are dynamic—they have a __morphology__, they change their shape depending on their context. The patterns are loosely defined with the assumption that every instance of a pattern will be uniquely shaped the way every leaf on a tree has the same structure but is unique in itself.</li>
      <li>The patterns relate to each other through a set of grammatical rules. The "sentence" has a sequential order and logic for how patterns fit together, and the design doesn't make sense if the words are out of order.</li>
      <li>A pattern language makes sense as a sequential whole, not as fragments. Projects created with pattern languages start whole and evolve as a whole throughout their development. The meta structure within and around the elements is as important as the elements themselves.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This might be called [[Grammatical design]] or [[Morphogenetic design]], comparable to a flower growing from a seed or telling a story over a fire.</p>

    <p>Pattern languages are not designed for a specific project or style. Like a spoken language, they can be shared within communities to ease communication and share discovered effective patterns. Shared pattern languages enable much higher order patterns to emerge that extend beyond individual projects and encompass entire ecosystems.</p>
