    <h1>A fantastic map of the web</h1>
    <h2>The web that is, the web that was, the web that could have been, the web that could be</h2>

    <p>When we look out over the web, thirty years into its life, what do we see? When we dig through the strata of web history, what artifacts do we find? When we imagine the next thirty or hundred years of life on the web, what do we imagine it might be like? What do we hope it will be like? How might we be stewards of its future?</p>

    <p>Let's survey the land. To the west, we can see the skyline of Big Social—the Twitter and Reddit city squares, the Facebook suburbs, the Instagram Luxury Resort, the Great Medium Bloghall, and the quirky borough of Tumblr. Permeating the bustle of the city are Amazon Megamarts on every corner. The Amazon Sewerworks and the Google Metro hum constantly beneath the city. On the streets, bots and humans mingle, indistinguishable from each other, blurring the shape of communication and social patterns. Mobs of anonymous trolls camp in the alleys.</p>

    <p>To the east is the Archipelago of Personal Websites and the wild frontier of the Open Web, dotted with isolated islands and woodland cabins with one inhabitant each, lonely as a single player Minecraft game, sending messages to eachother in archaic RSS and email bottles. These homesteaders are traditionalists. They want to see the return of the vibrant early web, or the return of what they think the early web was like. And they're out there, crafting, building, suggesting new ways for others to join them on the frontier.</p>

    <p>Beneath the advertising and surveillance covered streets of Big Social are underground networks of small communities—Discord servers, direct message chats, and carefully walled forums. The rogues who meet in these secret societies are faced with a dilemma—the Archipelago of Personal Websites lacks community that is the promise of the web. The city presents a constant, increasingly dangerous and disturbing assault on their privacy and the integrity of their social fabric. Staying cloaked in the underground is a cozy shelter, but means abandoning the Web that Was, the Web that Could Have Been, and the Web that Could Be, and losing what remains of the Open Web to the insatiable surveillance machine.</p>

    <p>This is the web we live in, the web we live with, the Web that Is. It's the web we love—beneath the dust, tracking scripts, and terms of use, hypertext is still magic, and every link is a miracle.</p>

    <p>What we can learn from the open web homesteaders—what works, what's missing, why nostalgia won't help.</p>

    <h2>All good things of this earth flow into the city</h2>

    <p>What we can learn from the cozyweb network—what works, what's missing, why fleeing won't help.</p>

    <h2>Digital spaces that live echo physical spaces that live</h2>

    <p>A vision of a healthy, living, diverse future for the web, and how it might emerge—introducing pattern languages.</p>
