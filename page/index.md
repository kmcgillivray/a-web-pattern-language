<h1 class="title">A Web Pattern Language</h1>

_A Web Pattern Language_ is a shared language for building the web together for anyone who cares about its future. Applying insights about homes, neighborhoods, and cities from Christopher Alexander's _A Pattern Language_, _A Web Pattern Language_ provides an introduction to designing with pattern languages and a collection of rules of thumb, approaches, and patterns covering everything from the entire web regions to small sections of individual web pages.

_(This is a draft-in-progress web book and always-evolving digital pattern garden. Many pages are incomplete or contain rough drafts.)_
