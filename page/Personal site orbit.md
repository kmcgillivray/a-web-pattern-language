While a personal website is the traditional center of [[A domain of one's own]], people need a space that represents their presence and identity within each digital social environment they join. In our physical communities, this is provided by our actual physical presence, role-playing behavior, and appearance. On the web, our identities are distributed between many profiles, pages, and locations that represent the spectrum of our roles within digital space.

A personal site orbit is a map of these distributed spaces. Create a [[Website for one person]] linked to a [[Primary domain address]] to serve as the gravitational center at the heart of the orbit. Within each shared space a person joins, create a [[Member alcove]] as space where they can determine their privacy preferences within that community and shape their presence there. Encourage the cultivation of subdomains for private and semi-private spaces within the orbit of the primary domain as needed for distinct areas of the person's various personal interests, projects, and professional life—[[Web workshops and gardens]], [[Website for a business]], [[Weblog]], [[Web book]], [[Website as a playground]]. Within all personally owned spaces, create opportunities for social interaction with visitors—friends, family, colleagues, and collaborators—[[Asynchronous comments]].
