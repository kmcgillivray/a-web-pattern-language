  <h1>Personal site orbit</h1>
  <div><p>While a personal website is the traditional center of <a href="https://kmcgillivray.github.io/a-web-pattern-language/a-domain-of-ones-own/" class="wikilink">A domain of one's own</a>, people need a space that represents their presence and identity within each digital social environment they join. In our physical communities, this is provided by our actual physical presence, role-playing behavior, and appearance. On the web, our identities are distributed between many profiles, pages, and locations that represent the spectrum of our roles within digital space.</p>
<p>A personal site orbit is a map of these distributed spaces. Create a <span class="nolink">Website for one person</span> linked to a <span class="nolink">Primary domain address</span> to serve as the gravitational center at the heart of the orbit. Within each shared space a person joins, create a <span class="nolink">Member alcove</span> as space where they can determine their privacy preferences within that community and shape their presence there. Encourage the cultivation of subdomains for private and semi-private spaces within the orbit of the primary domain as needed for distinct areas of the person's various personal interests, projects, and professional life—<span class="nolink">Web workshops and gardens</span>, <span class="nolink">Website for a business</span>, <span class="nolink">Weblog</span>, <span class="nolink">Web book</span>, <span class="nolink">Website as a playground</span>. Within all personally owned spaces, create opportunities for social interaction with visitors—friends, family, colleagues, and collaborators—<span class="nolink">Asynchronous comments</span>.</p></div>
